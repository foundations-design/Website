# Staging Protocol

0. Developer intends to release updates
1. Finalize CHANGELOG.md
2. Push latest development branch to staging (does need PR)
3. Create PR (staging -> master)
4. Write Release Notes (use CHANGELOG for reference)
5. Update hours on Project Overview document (do not update tasks at this time)
