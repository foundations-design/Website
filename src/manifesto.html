<h1 id="manifesto">The Foundations Manifesto</h1>
<p>
   The world is becoming digitized. For the first time in history, we have the power to connect the thoughts and
   feelings of every person into one network. Our smartphones are millions of times faster than the computers that first
   got us to the moon.
</p>
<p>
   Our digital tools can be used to improve productivity and foster collaboration between all peoples, and extract data
   and attention from an unwitting society.
</p>
<p>For better or for worst, these tools are transforming humanity.</p>
<p>
   Foundations Design promotes technology that supports people and empowers physical life, rather than tech that
   distracts us and monopolizes our attention. We support practices that improve our sensibilities and avoid interfaces
   that keep us staring at a screen.
</p>
<p>Just like you, we hope for a better future. In our humble opinion, that future begins on Earth.</p>
