# The Foundations Mission

The world is becoming digitized.<br>
Our phones are 1,000,000<span style="font-size: .8em;">x</span> faster than the computers that got us to the moon; we create 2,500,000,000 GBs of data every day; and, for the first time in history, we have the power to connect the thoughts and feelings of every person into one network.

This network is being used to improve productivity and foster collaboration between all peoples, and extract data and attention from an unwitting society.

For better or for worst, it's transforming humanity.

**Foundations promotes technology<br>
that supports people and empowers physical life,<br>
rather than tech that distracts us<br>
and monopolizes our attention.<br>
We support practices that improve our sensibilities<br>
and avoid interfaces that keep us staring at a screen.**

**Just like you, we hope for a better future.<br>
That future begins on Earth.**
